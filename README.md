# RSI-Blockchain: A Cryptographic Framework for Safe Recursive Self-Improvement

This repository contains an early-stage research draft proposing a
cryptographic architecture for **safe recursive self-improvement (RSI)** in artificial intelligence.

The core idea:
- **Proof-of-Learning (PoL)**: A verifiable cryptographic proof that a model update followed an allowed training process.
- **Difficulty Enforcement**: A Bitcoin-style computational cost to prevent uncontrolled or excessively rapid self-improvement.
- **Public Verifiability**: Every update is transparent, auditable, and tamper-resistant.

## Contents
- `rsi-blockchain-whitepaper.md` — Full technical draft  
- Future folders (`/spec`, `/code`) will include:
  - PoL prototype designs
  - Difficulty adjustment functions
  - Validation logic
  - Reference implementations

## Status
This is an **open research proposal**, not a finalized specification.
Feedback and formal critique are welcome.

## License

## Disclaimer
This project is *not* an endorsement of deploying self-improving AI systems.
The goal is to explore technical mechanisms for **verifiability**, **auditability**,  
and **controlled improvement**, inspired by cryptographic systems such as Bitcoin.
