# RSI-Blockchain: A Cryptographic Architecture for Safe Recursive Self-Improvement

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Early Research Draft  
**Author:** clear-synthesis-labs

## Overview
RSI-Blockchain is a proposed framework that combines **Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work**,  
**zero-knowledge Proof-of-Learning (PoL)**, and **auditable model-state transitions**  
to enable **safe recursive self-improvement (RSI)** in advanced AI systems.

Modern AI systems can rapidly update themselves. Without transparency or verification,  
this creates risks: uncontrolled capability growth, hidden behavioral changes,  
or adversarial fine-tuning.  
RSI-Blockchain aims to solve this by enforcing:

- **Verifiable learning steps (PoL)**
- **Tamper-proof model state transitions**
- **External difficulty limits on improvement speed**
- **Public auditability and consensus verification**

## Core Concepts

### 🔹 1. Proof-of-Learning (PoL)
A zero-knowledge proof that a model update was:
- computed correctly,
- applied to committed data,
- and followed an allowed training rule.

PoL makes learning *auditable*.

### 🔹 2. Difficulty Enforcement
A Bitcoin-like difficulty target adds:
- computational cost to each self-improvement step,
- rate-limiting,
- and protection against uncontrolled growth.

### 🔹 3. Consensus Validation
Each block contains:
- model state hash  
- PoL  
- difficulty  
- ethical constraint vector (optional module)

Nodes accept a block only if:
- PoL verifies,
- difficulty target is met,
- model transition is valid.
