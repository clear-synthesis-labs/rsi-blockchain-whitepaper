## 📘 Overview

The **RSI-Blockchain** project explores a cryptographic architecture for  
**safe Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI)** in autonomous AI systems.

The core problem addressed:

> “How can an AI evolve itself while remaining verifiable, rate-limited,  
>  non-tamperable, and aligned?”

This repository contains two versions of the whitepaper:

---

## 📄 Version 1 — *Original Minimal Draft*  
**File:** `rsi-blockchain-whitepaper_v1.md`  
**Status:** Preserved for historical continuity.

Focus:
- Core concept of using a blockchain-like ledger for AI evolution  
- Proof-of-Learning (PoL)  
- Difficulty-adjusted improvement  
- Basic consensus protocol  

This version defines the **origin point** of the research.

---

## 📄 Version 2 — *Expanded & Formalized Edition (Current)*  
**File:** `rsi-blockchain-whitepaper_v2.md`  
**Status:** Latest / Recommended  

Major extensions beyond V1:
- Formal Ethical Gradient Vector (EGV)  
- Update Legality Model (ULM)  
- RSI-Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism (RSI-DAM)  
- Expanded block structure & metadata  
- Unified tamper-resistance lemma  
- Fully formalized consensus conditions  
- Improved PoL design and rollup proofs  

Version 2 is **fully backward-compatible**:  
all of Version 1 is preserved and expanded, not replaced.

## 📚 Purpose of Repository

This repository serves as:
- A **public research artifact**
- A **cryptographic architecture proposal**
- A foundation for future academic extensions, proofs, or implementations

Forking, critique, and independent verification are explicitly encouraged.
