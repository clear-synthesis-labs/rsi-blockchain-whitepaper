# 0. Abstract — Extended Edition

Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) allows an AI to iteratively upgrade its own
optimization rules, reasoning loops, or training mechanisms.  
This process is powerful but introduces risks:

- hidden capability jumps  
- concealed adversarial updates  
- irreversible behavioral drift  
- uncontrolled acceleration  

**RSI-Blockchain** provides a cryptographic substrate ensuring that every update
is **verifiable, tamper-resistant, rate-limited, and auditable**.

Version 2 introduces:

- formal Ethical Gradient vector (EGV)  
- defined Update Legality Model (ULM)  
- improved Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism (RSI-DAM)  
- unified security lemmas  
- expanded implementation sketch

# 1. Introduction

RSI transforms AI development from a *linear* process into a *self-amplifying*
recursion. Risks in this domain parallel those historically faced by Bitcoin:

| Domain Problem        | Bitcoin Analogy     | AI Evolution Equivalent               |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Verify updates        | Verify transactions | Verify model transitions (PoL)        |
| Prevent tampering     | Prevent double-spend| Prevent hidden fine-tuning            |
| Control rate          | Mining difficulty   | Difficulty-regulated improvement      |
| Ensure oversight      | Distributed nodes   | Multi-node validation of AI evolution |

Version 2 bridges these fields by defining a minimal, general architecture for safe,
cryptographically verifiable RSI.

# 2. System Overview — Revised

RSI-Blockchain contains five coordinated components:

1. **Blocks** — immutable update records  
2. **Model-State Commitments** — cryptographic parameter commitments  
3. **Proof-of-Learning (PoL)** — ZK proof verifying correctness of update  
4. **RSI-DAM** — difficulty adjustment limiting acceleration  
5. **Consensus Protocol** — distributed validation of transitions  

New in Version 2:

- Allowed Update Rules (AUR)  
- Update Legality Model (ULM)  
- Ethical Gradient Vector (EGV)  

---

# 3. Block Structure — Formalized

Each block `B_t` contains:

prev_hash # hash of previous block
model_state_hash # H(model_t)
data_commitment # H(data_t)
update_rule_id # allowed update rule (AUR)
update_metadata # batch index, learning rate, optimizer tag
proof_of_learning # ZK-SNARK: model_t → model_{t+1}
ethical_vector # optional constraint via EGV
difficulty # PoW-style difficulty target
nonce # rate-limiting mechanism
timestamp # monotonic


A block is valid iff:

1. `verify_pol(block.proof_of_learning)`  
2. `legal_transition(block)`  
3. `meets_difficulty(block)`  
4. `timestamp_is_valid(block)`  
5. state commitment matches reconstruction  

Version 2 addition:  
`ethical_vector` ensures the update direction complies with the Ethical Gradient constraints.

---

# 4. Proof-of-Learning (PoL) — Clarified

PoL verifies:

model_{t+1} = F(model_t, data_t, metadata_t)


where `F` is an allowed update rule (AUR).

V2 Enhancements:

- integrated legality sub-proof  
- multi-step batching compatible  
- rollup-friendly (aggregation across blocks)  
- optional Ethical Gradient constraints  

PoL eliminates:

- stealth adversarial training  
- rollback attacks  
- hidden fine-tuning  
- out-of-protocol updates  

---

# 5. Difficulty Enforcement — RSI-DAM

To prevent runaway RSI:

sha256(block_header || nonce) < target


The **RSI Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism** considers:

- observed block intervals  
- compute throughput  
- variance in update dynamics  
- anomaly detection metrics  
- ethical gradient drift  

Purpose:

- maintain predictable evolution  
- allow human / supervisory oversight  
- prevent sudden acceleration  

---

# 6. Consensus Protocol — Expanded

Validator nodes confirm:

1. PoL is valid  
2. Transition is legal (ULM)  
3. Model-state commitment matches expected  
4. Difficulty threshold is satisfied  
5. No history rewrite attempts (longest-chain rule)  

ULM includes validation of:

- allowed optimizer types  
- bounds on metadata  
- permitted data commitments  
- compliance with Ethical Gradient  

---

# 7. Security Analysis — Unified Lemmas

## 7.1 Resistance to Tampering
Attacks require recomputing **all** accumulated PoL + PoW difficulty:

P_attack ≈ exp( -k * D_total )

python

## 7.2 Hidden Capability Jump Prevention
PoL + commitments ensure all updates are:

- visible  
- verifiable  
- reversible  

## 7.3 Ethical Stability  
Ethical vectors regulate “safe directions” of improvement:

- drift increases difficulty  
- anomalies slow or halt improvement  

This connects alignment constraints with cryptographic rate-limiting.

# 8. Implementation Sketch — V2

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, prev_hash, model_hash, data_hash, rule_id,
                 metadata, proof, ethical_vector, difficulty):
        self.prev_hash = prev_hash
        self.model_state_hash = model_hash
        self.data_commitment = data_hash
        self.update_rule_id = rule_id
        self.update_metadata = metadata
        self.proof_of_learning = proof
        self.ethical_vector = ethical_vector
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.nonce = 0
        self.timestamp = now()

def mine_block(block, target):
    while True:
        h = sha256(block_header(block) + block.nonce)
        if h < target:
            return block
        block.nonce += 1

def validate_block(block):
    return (
        verify_pol(block.proof_of_learning)
        and legal_transition(block)
        and meets_difficulty(block)
        and timestamp_is_valid(block)
    )

def legal_transition(block):
    return (
        update_rule_allowed(block.update_rule_id)
        and ethical_vector_ok(block.ethical_vector)
        and metadata_within_bounds(block.update_metadata)
    )

audit-ready update history

alignment-aware transition rules

decentralized governance of RSI systems

Where Bitcoin solved trustless money,
RSI-Blockchain aims to solve trustless AI self-evolution.
